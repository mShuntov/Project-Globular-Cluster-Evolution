This folder contains the master data (master_data_4.dat) that we will use to construct the evolution on the HRD diagram and also the python codes for that.

In the file evolution2.ipy the master data is being made and saved

In the file hrd_diagram.ipy the evolution on the HRD diagram is being done with the same method as before

In the file hrd_diagram.ipy I tried to do the evolution with a different method but it doesn't work

The file to_video.ipy is supposed to make a video out of the images that we save from the HRD evolution code, but this doesn't quite work.

The color is now done properly.

For the HRD evolution the only thing left to be done is to figure out how save it to a .mp4 video file.
